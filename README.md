# Car-Lister.de
This is a backend system for car dealers. It shows all the car details based on the real-time database from several car selling websites.
It was built in Codeigniter 3.1.9 and Metronic theme 4.7. This system also supports multi-language.

## Tutorial
Sample administrator and customer panel using codeigniter 3.1.9 with MySQL 5.7 and Metronic template 4.7.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Copy an example database file in config and replace host, username, password, db name with yours. It would be better if you have a database updated in real-time.
